# MERN Stack Kanban Board

A **full-stack Kanban board application** built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to manage tasks and workflows efficiently. This project implements both frontend and backend services, featuring authentication, task management, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project is organized into four main directories: `frontend`, `backend`,`infrastructure`, and `scripts`.

### **Backend** (`/backend`)
The backend is a Node.js application using Express to manage API routes and services.

#### **Key Files**
- **`Dockerfile.dev`**: Dockerfile for development environment setup.
- **`src/`**: Main source directory:
  - **`app.ts`**: Configures the Express application, adding middleware and routes.
  - **`config/`**: Contains configuration files (e.g., database connections).
  - **`controllers/`**: Handles API requests and responses.
  - **`middleware/`**: Middleware for authentication and other tasks.
  - **`models/`**: Mongoose schemas and models.
  - **`routes/`**: Defines API routes and maps them to controllers.
  - **`services/`**: Business logic and reusable functionalities.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **`tests/`**: Unit and integration tests for the backend (for now, there just tests related to authentification).

### **Frontend** (`/frontend`)
The frontend is a React application built with TypeScript and styled using Material-UI. It includes Redux for both local and server states management and utilizes hooks for reusability.

#### **Key Files**
- **`Dockerfile.dev`**: Dockerfile for development environment setup.
- **`src/`**: Main source directory:
  - **`assets/`**: Static files such as images and fonts.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
  - **`context/`**: React Contexts for global state management.
  - **`hooks/`**: Custom hooks for reusable logic.
  - **`pages/`**: Page components for different routes.
  - **`services/`**: API services and utility functions.
  - **`redux/`**: Manages application state with Redux Toolkit.
  - **`types/`**: Includes TypeScript type definitions.
  - **`utils/`**: Helper functions.

### **Infrastructure** (`/infrastructure`)
The infrastructure folder contains configuration and deployment files.

#### **Key Files**
- **`docker/`**: Docker-related configuration files.
- **`nginx/`**: Nginx configuration files for serving the application.
- **`tls/`**: TLS/SSL certificates for secure connections.

### **Scripts** (`/scripts`)
The scripts folder contains automation scripts for various tasks.

#### **Key Files**
- **`linux/`**: Scripts for Linux systems.
- **`win/`**: Scripts for Windows systems.

## üåê Network Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the network flow for the application, showing how HTTP/HTTPS requests are routed between components.

### Description
1. **HTTP/HTTPS Requests**:
   - All HTTP requests sent to port `80` are redirected to HTTPS on port `443`.
   - HTTPS requests on port `443` are handled by NGINX.

2. **Frontend**:
   - NGINX routes requests for the React application to the frontend container (`kanban_frontend`) on port `5173`.

3. **Backend**:
   - API requests (`/api/*`) are proxied by NGINX to the backend container (`kanban_backend`) on port `3000`.

4. **Database**:
   - The backend interacts with the MongoDB database (`kanban_database`) on port `27017` for data storage and retrieval.
